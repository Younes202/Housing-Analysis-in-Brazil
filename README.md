# Housing Analysis in Brazil 🇧🇷

Welcome👋, in this project, which involved analyzing a dataset of 21,000 properties to discern the impact of size versus location on real estate prices. I imported and cleansed data from a CSV file, unveiling key insights. Additionally, I explored the dataset through data visualization techniques, analyzed the relationship between home prices and area, and mapped the geographic distribution of properties 🚀.
