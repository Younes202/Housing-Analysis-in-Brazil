# Housing Analysis in Mexico

In this project, we'll delve into a dataset comprising 21,000 properties for sale in Mexico, sourced from the real estate website Properati.com. Our primary aim is to discern whether sale prices are predominantly influenced by property size or location.

## Objectives

Throughout this project, we'll develop skills in the following areas:

- Organizing information using fundamental Python data structures.
- Importing and cleansing data from CSV files utilizing the pandas library.
- Crafting data visualizations such as scatter and box plots.
- Analyzing the correlation between two variables to unravel insights.

By mastering these techniques, we'll be better equipped to explore and interpret real-world datasets, enabling us to draw meaningful conclusions from our analyses.
