# Housing Analysis in Brazil 🇧🇷

Welcome👋, in this project, which involved analyzing a dataset of 21,000 properties to discern the impact of size versus location on real estate prices. I imported and cleansed data from a CSV file, unveiling key insights. Additionally, I explored the dataset through data visualization techniques, analyzed the relationship between home prices and area, and mapped the geographic distribution of properties 🚀. 


## Project Overview

- **Organize information using basic Python data structures**📊🐍

- **Import data from CSV files and clean it using the pandas library**📈📊🧹

- **Create data visualizations like scatter and box plots**📊📉📦

- **Examine the relationship between two variables using correlation**🔍📈🔄
