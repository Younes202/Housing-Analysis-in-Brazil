# Housing Analysis in Mexico

Welcome to my project repository for the Applied Data Science Lab at WorldQuant University! In this project, I conducted an analysis of housing trends in Mexico, exploring the impact of various factors such as size and location on real estate prices.

## Project Overview

This project involved:

- Importing and cleansing a dataset of 21,000 properties from a CSV file.
- Exploring the dataset through data visualization techniques.
- Analyzing the relationship between home prices and area.
- Mapping the geographic distribution of properties.

## Key Insights

- Histogram Distribution of Home Prices: Visualized to understand market trends.
- Mean Home Price by Region: Identified areas of high and low real estate values.
- Scatter Plot Showing Price vs Area: Explored pricing dynamics.
- Scatter Map_box Showing the Location of Properties: Visualized geographic distribution.

## Skills Developed

- Data exploration and cleaning with Pandas.
- Data visualization techniques including histograms, scatter plots, and map_box visualizations.
- Application of data science to real estate markets.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Nicholas Cifuentes-Goodbody for his exceptional instruction and guidance throughout this project. Your support has been invaluable.

## Next Steps

I'm looking forward to tackling the next challenge, Project 2 on Apartment Sales in Buenos Aires!
